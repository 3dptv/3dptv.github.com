# How does it work?

1. open http://prose.io
2. authorize your github account
3. browse to the directory `_posts/`
4. edit the files, name them automatically as year-month-date-title.markdown
5. edit Metadata according to the example below:


    `layout: post`
    
    `author: Your Name`
    
    `author_url: your url`
    
    `author_email: your e-mail`
    
    `title: Title`
    
    `published_date: Tue. Oct 17, 2012`
