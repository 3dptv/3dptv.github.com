# The development is shifted to www.openptv.net

Follow most of the new stuff on [OpenPTV](http://www.openptv.net) and [OpenPTV/Github](http://github.com/openptv)

New developments are Cmake that allows you to compile and run 3D-PTV on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X and change of Tcl/Tk from (leaking) 8.4 to 8.6. Faster and safer ever.
