Objectives
----------

Our main goal is to promote the 3D-PTV experimental technology and
open it for the worldwide use. We are convinced that this technique
can make an impact in various applications, allowing for the
researchers and industry to get a deeper insight into their flows.
Most of the flows are highly complex and turbulent and only few of
them can get a limited low-dimensional or analytical description that
explains the different flow phenomena. Experimental research is
inevitable in observing the flow and discovering new phenomena, in
addition to assisting to explain the old ones.




Introduction
------------

The **3D Particle Tracking Velocimetry** (PTV) offers a flexible
technique for the determination of velocity fields in flows. It is
based on the visualization of a flow with small, neutrally buoyant
particles and a stereoscopic recording image sequences of the
particles. In the past decade the successful research work performed
by the Institute of Geodesy and Photogrammetry at ETH Zurich led to an
operational and reliable measurement tool used in hydrodynamics and
space applications. In cooperation with the Institute of
Hydromechanics and Water Resources Management at ETH Zurich further
progress has been achieved in the improvement of the existing hard-
and software solutions. Regarding the hardware setup the acquisition
system used at the ETH Zurich was upgraded from offline to online
image digitization.









** Data acquisition **
----------------------


+ Seed a flow with tracer particles
+ Illuminate a 3-D observation volume inside the flow by a pulsed
  lightsource
+ Image the scene by 2 (or rather 3-4) synchronized
+ Length of image sequences depending from imaging rate and storage
  device


The system used at the ETH Zurich was upgraded from offline to online
image digitization. In the previous system, the image sequences were
firstly recorded on analogue videotapes and digitized afterwards,
while in the new system two frame grabbers (Matrox Genesis) are used
to provide online digitization and storage. The length of the recorded
digital image sequences is nowadays restricted by the storage device
capabilities. The data rate for a 60 Hz full-frame camera with a
resolution of 640 x 480 pixels is about 19 MB/sec, and hence in an
experiment which lasts for 1 minute four cameras deliver a total
amount of about 4.5 GB image data.


**The Particle Tracking Velocimetry software performs the following
tasks:**


+ Calibration of the multi-camera system (determination of camera
  exterior and interior orientations, lens distortion and further
  disturbances, (e.g. [PDF of Willneff and Maas,2000>`http://www.tu-
  dresden.de/fghgipf/forschung/material/publ2000/JoWi_paper.pdf`_]) and
  the exact geometric modelling ("multimedia geometry" - each beam from
  a particle to the sensor passes the three optical media water, glass,
  air with different refractive indices, which leads to a twice broken
  beam).
+ Image preprocessing: perform highpass filtering due to non-
  uniformities in the background illumination
+ Detect particles in the images by a modified thresholding operator,
  localize particles with subpixel accuracy by a centroid operator
+ Establish stereoscopic correspondences
+ Determine 3-D particle coordinates
+ Storage of all relevant object and image space information
+ Perform tracking in 2-D image and 3-D object space








Data Processing
---------------


+ Image preprocessing: perform highpass filtering due to non-
  uniformities in the background illumination
+ Detect particles in the images by a modified thresholding operator,
  localize particles with subpixel accuracy by a centroid operator
+ Establish stereoscopic correspondences
+ Determine 3-D particle coordinates
+ Storage of all relevant object and image space information
+ Perform tracking in 2-D image and 3-D object space


**A crucial point is the handling of ambiguities occuring in different
steps of the data processing chain:**


+ Particles may overlap in the images. For that reason a modified
  thresholding/centroid operator was developed searching for local
  maxima in the images and dividing particle images at local minima
  under certain conditions.
+ Due to the fact that particle images cannot be distinguished by
  features like size, shape or color, the only criterion for the
  establishment of stereoscopic correspondences is the epipolar line.
  Ambiguities occur when multiple candidates are found in a search area
  defined by the epipolar line. These ambiguities can only be solved if
  a third (or even a fourth) camera is being used.
+ Ambiguities may also occur in the tracking procedure. Criteria like
  local correlation and smoothness of the velocity field are employed to
  solve these criteria.


Another important issue is an accurate calibration of the system
(determination of camera exterior and interior orientations, lens
distortion and further disturbances) and the exact geometric modelling
("multimedia geometry" - each beam from a particle to the sensor
passes the three optical media water, glass, air with different
refractive indices, which leads to a twice broken beam).







Potential
---------


+ Truely 3-D technique: all three components of the velocity field are
  determined in a 3-D observation volume
+ Delivers 3-D vector field for Eulerian analysis plus 3-D
  trajectories for Lagrangian analysis
+ A system based on 4 CCD progressive scan cameras (digitized to 640 x
  480 pixels) is capable of tracking more than 1000 particles
+ The ralative accuracy of the velocity vectors is ~ 1:4000 of the
  field of view








** Real time image processing schemes **
----------------------------------------


+ Real time image compression using a customized FPGA design,

We organize the PTV benchmarking (open, free and user-friendly, we'll
publish only what you want to be published) in order to make our
algorithms validated versus each other and improve our particle
tracking abilities worldwide. Write to `Alex`_ if you want to **join**
with your own version of particle tracking software or with your data
test case (e.g. that you find difficult to track or to improve).
