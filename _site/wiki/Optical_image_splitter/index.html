This results in several 		virtual viewing points, thus allowing for stereoscopic imaging with just one single camera.		</p>				<img style="width: 300px; " alt="Optical Image Splitter" src="../../image/optical_image_splitter.jpg">		<br>				<h3> Why use it?</h3>				<p> Sometimes you either do not have the money to spend on several cameras, or you do not have the space to squeeze 		four 5kg cameras in front of your tiny flow setup. Then it is time to use an image splitter system like it is		 used in IfU at ETH Zurich, in the <a href="http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/turbulencelab"> Turbulence Structure Laboratory </a> in Tel Aviv University, 		 or in the <a href="http://www.safl.umn.edu/researchgroup/michele-guala"> St. Anthony Falls  Laboratories </a>, University of Minnesota. 		</p>		<h3> How much does it cost?</h3>		<p>		Of the shelf a complete system can be purchased via <a href="http://www.photrack.ch">photrack Ltd</a> for the 		price of separate parts, integration and transport. 				The mirror setup is shown and you can order the parts on your own, directly from Linos, 		and likely slightly cheaper. The pyramid drawings are also available from <a href="http://www.photrack.ch">photrack Ltd</a>. 		The <a href="http://3dptv.github.com"> software </a> will require some adaptations and fine tuning that are available from the same source. 		</p>
